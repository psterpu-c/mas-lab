"""FT8 — per-agent observability scoping.

An agent manifest's own non-empty ``spec.observability`` already causes
``RuntimeInstance.from_spec`` to build and subscribe a private plugin set at
materialization time (see ``mas.runtime.spec.parser.parse_agent_spec``).
Before this fix, ``setup_shared_obs`` blindly attached the run's shared set to
every instance regardless, so a self-scoped agent's operator ended up
subscribed to *two* plugin sets (its own + the shared one) instead of being
cleanly isolated. These tests cover the partition/finalize helpers that fix
that.
