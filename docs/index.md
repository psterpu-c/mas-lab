# MAS-Lab

**A specification-driven foundation** for multi-agent systems that are testable,
reproducible, observable, and governable.

Multi-agent demos are easy to build; production-grade systems are not. MAS-Lab
helps teams close that gap with declarative specs, runtime enforcement, and
repeatable experiments — without gluing everything together in prompts and scripts.

## What it is

MAS-Lab is an open toolkit for **engineering** multi-agent systems. You describe
agents, teams, tools, workflows, and policies in YAML; the runtime executes and
checks behavior at important boundaries; experiments and traces let you compare
designs and audit what happened.

The same specification travels from local development through benchmarks to
governed deployment — intent stays explicit instead of scattered across code and
prompts.

## Why it exists

As systems grow, behavior becomes hard to reproduce, debug, and govern. Small
changes to prompts, tools, or coordination can silently shift outcomes. MAS-Lab
separates **what the system should do** from **what it actually did at runtime**,
and connects them with specs, contracts, overlays, and observability.

## Who it is for

**Developers** — build modular agent apps from specs instead of one-off glue.
Declare agents, tools, and workflows once, then iterate safely across models and
coordination patterns.

**Enterprises** — roll out agentic workflows with governance, traceability, and
operational control. Policies and budgets attach as overlays without rewriting
core logic.

**Researchers** — run controlled, multi-run campaigns; vary designs and
infrastructure; replay trajectories with reproducibility built in.

## Where to start

If you are new to MAS-Lab, begin with
[Tutorial 0 — Environment setup](tutorials/00-environment-setup/README.md) to
install the stack and run your first commands. The [Web UI](ui/index.md) lets you
browse manifests and inspect runs in the browser. For context on what shipped in
this release, read the
