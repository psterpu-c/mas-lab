# MAS-Lab paper

*MAS-Lab: A Specification-Driven Validation Framework for Reliable Multi-Agent
Systems*

The article introduces the specification-driven model behind MAS-Lab. **Section 5**
reports experiments that are reproduced in this repository as three runnable labs.

---

## What you can reproduce

| Lab | Paper section | What it explores |
|-----|---------------|------------------|
| `design-space.lab` | §5.1 | Design patterns and team topologies |
| `lifecycle-control.lab` | §5.2 | Governance and lifecycle control |
| `extensions.lab` | §5.3 | Memory and context overlays |

Source under [`labs/`](https://github.com/outshift-open/mas-lab/tree/main/labs) in the repository.

Each lab is a single benchmark experiment. Run it, and MAS-Lab produces the
figures and tables reported in the paper — charts, metrics, and comparison
reports — without separate plotting scripts.

Hands-on introduction: [Tutorial 3 — Run an experiment](../tutorials/03-experiments-and-analysis/README.md).

---

## Quick reproduction

After [Tutorial 0](../tutorials/00-environment-setup/README.md) (install and LLM
access), from the repository root:

```bash
task reproduce
```

This runs all Section 5 experiments in sequence. To run one lab:

```bash
mas-lab benchmark run labs/design-space.lab/01-design-patterns/experiment.yaml --progress
```

Completed runs are cached — re-running refreshes reports without repeating LLM
calls when inputs are unchanged. See [User configuration](../user-config.md) for
output locations.
