    When the runtime emits ``call_id`` / ``parent_call_id`` on the event

    below), never by comparing agent/type/name/timestamp. Older traces that
    lack ``call_id`` entirely fall back to a synthetic per-key FIFO pairing
    (``open_calls``) so ``_build_call_tree`` still has something to work with,
    but this path is never used once the runtime assigns real ids.

    # of two same-agent/same-tool calls an ``_end_missing`` record actually
    # belonged to by comparing tool_name + start_ts within ``_TS_TOL``. That
    # heuristic existed only because the runtime never emitted
    # tool_call_end/memory_call_end for ANY call (a dead-code bug in
    # obs_envelope.py's OBSERVABILITY_POST_EXECUTE handling — see
    # runtime/src/mas/runtime/machines/obs_envelope.py and
    # runtime/src/mas/runtime/kernel/ingress_step.py's op misclassification
    # for MEMORY_OP). Now that both are fixed, every engine-op call gets its
    # own real end event with the SAME call_id its own start used — verified
    # by instrumenting this exact matching logic against all 4 golden
    # fixtures (lifecycle-control, extensions, design-space, lab-smoke) and
    # confirming it never fires. ``_end_missing`` can now only mean a call
    # that was genuinely still open when the trace was cut (handled below by
    # the t_final/+1.0s fallback), not a duplicate to reconcile.

    # NOTE: a timestamp-based "impossible children" reparenting pass used to
    # live here — walking a record's parent_call_id chain and promoting it to
    # its grandparent whenever start_ts landed at/after the parent's own
    # end_ts (within _TS_TOL). Removed outright: parent_call_id is a real,
    # runtime-assigned fact (see _build_call_tree), never something a
    # timestamp comparison gets to override — timestamps are for display/
    # ordering only. The apparent "impossible" cases this used to "fix" were
    # never a wrong parent link; they were an artifact of a timestamp-
    # fabrication bug in library-standard's native export layer
    # (dispatch_boundary re-stamping every boundary event with the async
    # export-time `time.time()` instead of the real occurrence-time
    # TransitionEvent.timestamp — see project.py's boundary_dict_from_transition
    # and boundary_handlers.py's dispatch_boundary), which made an agent's own
    # tool_call_end appear to land after its own execution_end even though it
    # truly happened first. That bug is fixed at its real source; reparenting
    # based on the (now-correct) timestamps would still have been the wrong
    # mechanism even when it happened to look right.

    # NOTE: delegated sub-agent executions no longer need to be re-linked
    # here. The runtime now threads a real `caller_call_id` through the
    # delegation contract itself (InvokeEngineIo.call_id -> execute_engine_tool
    # -> DelegationContract -> RunTurnFn, resolved once by the driver via
    # ObservabilityOperator.call_id_for right before the engine is invoked —
    # see runtime/src/mas/runtime/driver/driver.py), so a peer's own
    # execution_start.parent_call_id already IS the delegating tool call's
    # own call_id on the wire, for every delegation depth (including nested
    # ones — see ctl/.../mas_session.py's wire_peer_delegation). No
    # timestamp-proximity or tool-name reconstruction needed: _build_call_tree
    # already builds the correct tree from parent_call_id alone.

    # Fix synthetic end_ts for governance-orphaned LLMCalls.
    # When governance fires between two llm_call_start events, the first call
    # never receives an llm_call_end and gets the placeholder end_ts of
    # start_ts + 1.0.  Replace that with the start_ts of the chronologically
    # next sibling LLMCall so that the orphan's duration is accurate (≈ the
    # time until governance handed off to the next call) and child records
    # (e.g. memory_search ToolCalls nested under the orphan) don't get their
