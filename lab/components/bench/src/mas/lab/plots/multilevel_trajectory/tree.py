    **Delegation tool as a dispatch marker** (structural, zero name heuristics):

    A ToolCall is a *delegation tool* when its children in the call tree
    include at least one AgentCall record (``children_of[tool_id]`` contains
    a record with ``level == "agent"``) — this is the call that hands off to
    another agent, so this lane is a genuine DFS walk of the call tree: the
    delegation tool is the last node of the delegating agent's own segment,
    immediately followed by the delegate's own calls, exactly as they appear
    in the tree. Its *true* span covers the whole delegated execution (it's a
    synchronous call-and-wait, so its end_ts is whenever the delegate
    returns) — rendering it at full width would overlap the delegate's own
    calls, which occupy that same window in this shared lane row. It is
    rendered as an instant dispatch marker instead (a zero-width copy, timing
    only — the real record elsewhere is untouched), the same treatment any
    nearly-instant ToolCall already gets.

    ``reset_branch_agent_call_ids`` (agent call_ids that are the 2nd..Nth
    sibling of a fork — see ``_reset_branch_agent_call_ids``) each get their
    own subtree's first call-level record tagged ``_branch_entry``, and the
    delegating marker right before them gets a wider reserved gap than an
    ordinary marker (see ``_reserve_marker_width``). Both matter for
    ``_assign_dfs_positions``: an ordinary marker's end and the next record's
    start are deliberately made to *coincide* (one shared boundary, no gap —
    the normal case everywhere else in this lane); but for a reset-triggering
    marker, that would collapse the marker's own close and the new branch's
    entry onto the same timestamp, leaving nowhere to insert the
    branch-reset boundary and making the marker look like it belongs to the
    new branch instead of closing out the old one.

        all fragments share the same ``call_id``, but each fragment must only
        claim calls that start within its time slice.

        NOTE on why this one still needs a time window at all (unlike the
        heuristics removed elsewhere this session): a repeatedly-delegated
        agent's OWN AgentCall record gets a distinct id per invocation
        (records.py's collision-renaming pass), but every LLMCall/ToolCall
        that invocation makes still carries the runtime's ORIGINAL (reused,
        coarser ``{agent_id}-{turn_id}-exec``) id as its own parent_call_id —
        the runtime itself doesn't hand out a distinct id per invocation for
        children to point at. So ``children_of[original_id]`` genuinely pools
        every invocation's children under one id; WHICH invocation a pooled
        child belongs to is not recoverable from any id in the trace at all,
        only from which invocation's time window it falls in. This is a real
        runtime-side gap (the fix would be threading a per-invocation id
        through the same way ``caller_call_id`` now is for delegation), not a
        lab-side choice to ignore an id that's already there.

        ``hard_upper``, when given, caps the upper bound below the usual
        ``ts_end + _TS_TOL`` slack — needed when this same ``call_id`` is
        shared by a LATER agent_sequence fragment too (a repeatedly-delegated
        agent reusing one runtime id): without this cap, an earlier turn's
        ``_TS_TOL`` tolerance can reach across the exact (Rule-2-set) zero-gap
        boundary and greedily claim (via ``seen_ids``, first-come-first-served)
        a call that starts just after the boundary but structurally belongs to

    """Give each zero-duration delegation dispatch marker its own tiny slot,
    and give each branch entry a genuinely separate timestamp from whatever
    marker(s) precede it.

    _align_record_boundaries snaps a delegation marker's start_ts to exactly
    match the delegating agent's own dispatch instant — which, by the same
    Rule 1 ("first child starts when its parent starts"), is *also* the
    start_ts the delegate's own first call gets once it's appended later in
    this same sequence (via agent_sequence's own entry for that agent).
    Without a reserved width, the marker and the delegate's own first
    boundary collapse onto the identical pixel column (state_reg dedups by
    exact ts).

    Walks the whole (already DFS-ordered) sequence once with a monotonic
    "claimed up to" cursor — a plain pairwise ``seq[i+1]`` check isn't enough
    here: when an LLM turn dispatches several delegate_to_X calls at once
    (a sibling batch), ALL of their markers land consecutively in this list,
    collected together before ANY of their subtrees are visited (see
    ``_make_call_sequence``'s outer loop) — so the record immediately after
    a given reset-triggering marker is often the *next marker*, not that
    marker's own branch entry. Only ever advances timestamps forward, never
    backward — same rule as ``_stagger_coinc_processing_calls`` — and shifts
    a record's end_ts by the same delta as its start_ts when bumped, so a
    real (non-zero) duration is never corrupted.

    A record tagged ``_branch_entry`` (see ``_make_call_sequence``) needs a
    full extra tick beyond the cursor, not just snapped to meet it — a
    genuinely distinct timestamp from whatever marker(s) just closed out the
    delegating agent's own segment. Without that extra separation,
    ``_assign_dfs_positions`` would find the branch entry's start_ts already
    claimed (by the last marker's own end bookkeeping) and skip inserting
    the reset there entirely — the marker would then render as if it
    belonged to the new branch instead of closing out the old one.

    The cursor only ever ADVANCES on a ``_delegation_marker`` or
    ``_branch_entry`` record's own end — never on an ordinary call. An
    ordinary call is still checked against the cursor (so a fork's rank-0
    branch, whose first real call would otherwise collapse onto its own
    dispatching marker's timestamp, still gets pushed clear of the whole
    marker cluster), but it must never let the cursor advance PAST its own
    end: an ordinary ``_end_missing`` call's end_ts is a synthetic
    ``start_ts + 1.0`` placeholder, not a real duration — if it were allowed
    to raise the cursor, every subsequent real call in that same agent's own
    subtree would get dragged forward by however long that placeholder
    happens to be, corrupting a perfectly legitimate later call's real
    start/end (observed: a real 6s LLM call shifted a full extra second,
    stretching its bar past the point its own agent had already finished and
    the next agent had resumed — a call rendered as if straddling two
    different agents' segments).
