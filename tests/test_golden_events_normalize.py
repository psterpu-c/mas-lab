"""Unit tests for the golden-run events normalization/comparison sort.

Concurrent agents each get their own async plugin-dispatch worker thread, so
two runs of the *same* logical trace can interleave different agents'
event streams in a different order. ``normalize_events_lines`` sorts events
to cancel this out before comparison; these tests exercise that sort
directly, without spinning up a real benchmark run.
